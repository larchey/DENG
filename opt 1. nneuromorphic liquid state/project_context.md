# Doctorate of Engineering Project Context

## Program Details
- **Institution**: Johns Hopkins University
- **Program Type**: Doctorate of Engineering (project-based)
- **Funding**: Employer-sponsored (requires justification)

## Project Overview: Distributed Policy-Aware Configuration Drift Detection

### Main Application (Company IP)
- **Purpose**: Fleet-scale configuration drift detection and policy enforcement
- **Platform**: Elasticsearch integration / Elastic Agent plugin
- **Target Environment**: 100+ RHEL 8.10 server fleets with heterogeneous configurations
- **Ownership**: Company intellectual property

### Operational Requirements
- **Fleet Management**: Monitor servers with different approved baseline configurations
- **Policy Enforcement**: Distinguish between approved changes and unauthorized drift
- **Role-Based Monitoring**: Web servers, database servers, baseline servers, development environments
- **Real-Time Response**: Immediate detection and fleet-wide coordination

### Doctoral Research Component: Distributed Neuromorphic Fleet Intelligence
**Research Focus:** Policy-aware distributed neuromorphic systems for infrastructure management

**Novel Contributions:**
- Hierarchical liquid state machines for fleet coordination
- Policy-encoding neural networks for context-aware drift detection
- Multi-agent neuromorphic communication protocols
- Distributed learning algorithms for fleet-scale intelligence

**Academic Value:**
- First application of neuromorphic computing to distributed policy enforcement
- Novel distributed intelligence architecture
- Breakthrough in energy-efficient fleet monitoring

## Goals
1. **Research Phase**: Develop distributed neuromorphic fleet intelligence algorithms
2. **Implementation Phase**: Create scalable policy-aware monitoring system
3. **Integration Phase**: Deploy within Elasticsearch ecosystem

## Key Constraints
- **IP Separation**: Company owns fleet monitoring tool, researcher owns neuromorphic algorithms
- **Enterprise Scalability**: Must handle hundreds to thousands of servers
- **Policy Compliance**: Critical for enterprise security and compliance requirements
- **Energy Efficiency**: Neuromorphic approach must demonstrate significant power savings
